So it seems you may be able to keep git from tracking a file without deleting
it from the remote repo using

    git update-index --skip-worktree <file_name>

to start tracking it again use

    git update-index --no-skip-worktree <file_name>

to list all flagged files use

    git ls-files -v|grep '^S'
